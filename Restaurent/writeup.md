Firstly I downloaded the webp file which is smaller in size than that of a png and jpg along with good quality.
After I have observed the image and as I am from andhrapradesh and I know hyderabad especially charminar center as it is famous.
After I have rechecked once with lens and my assumption is true, then I have asked google which are the famous hotels opened opened in that particular year.
I have got answers like shadab and bawarchi, then I have checked for menus in google maps then I tried 260 as flag and it is true.
