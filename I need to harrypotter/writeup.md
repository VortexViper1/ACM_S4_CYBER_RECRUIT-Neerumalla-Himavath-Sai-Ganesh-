Firstly I have downloaded the pcap file which contains packets or requests.
After I filtered packets with http and manually see PACKET BYTES PANE which is the bottom right corner contains hexa decimal data as well as ASCII data but no use.
After I export those as objects and I got some jpgs, I checked those with exiftool, if there are comments and lastly it is true in the file "ron.jpg" I have got the flag.


flag -- ACM{w3_4r3_cyb3r}
