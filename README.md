CyberSecurity
Hello, this is Ganesh. I am a cybersecurity student with a strong interest in the field of cybersecurity because it focuses on protecting systems, networks, and data from cyber threats, while also understanding how systems can be ethically tested for vulnerabilities.
I am particularly interested in using tools such as John the Ripper for password security testing, Nmap for network scanning, Wireshark for packet analysis. These tools help in identifying vulnerabilities and strengthening system defenses.
